# EDA - The Olympics
## Introduction
EDA - The Olympics is a Python - Data Analyst project i worked on during Data Analyst cousre.
The project deals with 4 research questions:
  1. What is the distribution of athletes over the years by gender?
  2. What is the optimal age and weight for winning an Olympic medal?
  3. What is the distribution for winning an Olympic medal in men's and women's football?
  4. What is the number of medals for the United States Olympic team and its rank?

In order to solve the research questions, I used the following tools:
  1. Python - Jupiter Notebook.
  2. Pandad.
  3. Seaborn.
  4. Matplotlib.

In order to present the data analysis in a beautiful and convenient way, I used graphs that present the information in a simple and convenient way.
You are invited to enter the Jupiter Source File file to view the analysis of the data, and enter the PowerPoint presentation to view the data analisyst, the conclusions and insights.
